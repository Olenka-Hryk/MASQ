# MASQ - Metric Analyzer Software Quality 
![](/Readme images/github-readme-image-emblem.png)

>As a result of the analysis of the current state of evaluation of software quality, as well as available tools and methods for its evaluation, it was found that there are a large number of them, but they are all separate and not unified. Therefore, there is a need for their generalization and development of a software tool that takes into account the influence of various factors in quality management.

***MASQ*** - is a software tool for determining the [software quality] by methods of [metric analysis], which provides the ability to predict its further successful development and formation of the corresponding set of data.

#
**KEY POSSIBILITIES:**
  - Ð¡alculates [software metrics with accurate and predicted values] at the design stage,  by calculation and expert methods
  - Analysis and processing metric estimates
  - Providing recommendations and conclusions
  - Predicting the success of development investigated software 
  - Finding a [ANN, artificial neural networks] plural for a quantitative quality assessment
  - Graphic representation of results

## Getting Started

<a name="markdown-header-clone"></a>
#### Clone the Repository
 As usual, you get started by cloning the project to your local machine:
 ```sh
 $ git://github.com/
 ```
 
 
<a name="markdown-prerequisites"></a>
#### Prerequisites 
1. .NET Core SDK 2.1 (v. 2.1.400) or later versions.
2. Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2017
3. Git


<a name="markdown-header-installation"></a>
#### Installation
The easiest way to use these programm without using `Git` is to download the `zip file` containing the current version. You can then unzip the entire archive and use this program in `Visual Studio .NET 2017`.

For more info about the programming models, platforms, languages, and APIs demonstrated in this app, please refer to the guidance available in [MSDN].



<a name="markdown-header-built-with"></a>
## Built With
Development environment for this application is `Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2017`.

This project use the following `libraries`:
* LiveCharts.Wpf 0.9.7


Used `technologys` and `tools`:
* [Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2017] - for develop application
* [WPF .NET] - for development a modern user interface
* [NuGet Package Manager] - provide the ability to consume packages
* [LiveCharts] - for data visualization

## Project Screen Shots
Get started with the program ***MASQ***. The initial application splash-window:
![](/Readme images/github-readme-image-start-window.png)

The main window of the program consists of a toolbar, a list of metrics, a workspace, a user logging area, a resulting area:
![](/Readme images/github-readme-image-example-find-metric-1.png)

The working area of the quality metrics for each metric varies depending on the way of finding. For example, finding a *DP quality metric with predicted values* has such a workspace:
![](/Readme images/github-readme-image-example-find-metric-2.png)

Also, there are metrics that are solved in several stages and use certain algorithms. Then there is a logical switch between the windows in search of the correct result. All results such metrics are submitted in formulas:
![](/Readme images/github-readme-image-example-find-result.png)

Besides the main features of the program there are additional options. Search for a specific metric, search for a parameter, enter the initial data, user manual, and so on:
![](/Readme images/github-readme-image-all-possibility-in-use.png)

The graphical representation of data takes place in three stages: tabular, histogram, graph. Also based on the results the program generate conclusion:

The complete user manual can be found [here].
